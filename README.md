# BedroomParty
An application that lets you create and share "bedrooms" 

# Bedrooms
Users can log in and begin to create bedrooms or look through the share gallery to 
see what others have created. Each bedroom contains a playlist, gallery, and noise setting. 

# Designing A Bedroom 
Use the mood button to add playlists from soundcloud, add direct image links into a timed 
gallery slideshow, and choose a noise via the slider. 

# Sharing
Clicking the share button will save your bedroom and host it on the share gallery where everyone
can see your room(s).
